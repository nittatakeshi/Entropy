Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis described in an article by Nitta et al, entitiled “The fibroblast: an emerging key player in thymic T cell selection” (Immunological Reviews).  Data of thymic stromal cells were extracted from the GSE dataset (accession no. GSE103967, experiment ID: thymus_stroma_WT), and graph-based clustering was performed using the Seurat R Package (v.3.1.2) after normalization and cell cycle correction.
